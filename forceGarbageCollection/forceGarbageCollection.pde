 /*******************************************
Gaol:
force JVM system to do garbage collection to improve performance in some situations,
especially while a program will run all day in an exhibition.

by experience, this is a very useful way on releasing unused RAMs to improve program's performance


NOTE:
GarbageCollector class is also a thread
it will auto do the GC (Garbage Collection) after use start() method!
